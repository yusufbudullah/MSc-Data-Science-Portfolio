# Operational Research & Optimisation: Restaurant Operations & Process Modelling

This project applies optimisation, probabilistic modelling, network analysis, and simulation techniques to improve planning, decision-making, and operational efficiency in a restaurant environment.

## The Challenge
As both analyst and manager, the goal was to use mathematical methods to improve real operational decisions:

1. **Planning Efficiency:** Assign tasks and schedule activities within deadlines
2. **Demand & Behaviour Prediction:** Understand customer arrivals and movement patterns
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Improve staffing, routing, and service performance

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two primary sections.

### Section A: Optimisation, Forecasting & Strategic Decisions
This section focuses on preparation and long-term planning.

* **Task Assignment (Linear Programming)**  
  Binary integer model assigning 8 tasks to 4 staff with workload and deadline constraints (12-day completion).

* **Risk & Return Allocation**  
  Investment allocation across menu items while minimising risk and meeting required return.

* **Demand Prediction (Markov Chain)**  
  Long-run probabilities of daily customers (50–120 customers).

* **Customer Movement (Absorbing Markov Chain)**  
  Probability customers reach the booth from each area to evaluate layout effectiveness.

* **Project Scheduling (PERT/CPM)**  
  Critical path identified and high probability of completion within 14 days.

### Section B: Simulation & Operational Efficiency
This section evaluates real operational decisions and performance.

* **Workforce Scheduling Optimisation**  
  Compared 3-hour and 4-hour shifts → same cost, fewer workers with 4-hour shift (recommended).

* **Decision Tree Analysis**  
  Sampling vs direct selling → direct selling gives higher expected profit.

* **Network Routing Optimisation**  
  Shortest delivery path using graph algorithms (17 km).

* **Queue Simulation (Single-Server System)**  
  Service performance evaluation: low waiting probability (~21%) and ~5 minute service time; peak-time staffing improvement suggested.
