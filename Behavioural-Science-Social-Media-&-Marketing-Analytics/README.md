# Behavioural Science, Social Media & Marketing Analytics: Sony Interactive Entertainment

This project investigates the intersection of consumer psychology and digital marketing within the gaming industry. It features a deep-dive analysis of **Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation)**, evaluating its marketing strategies and competitive standing against **Xbox** through the lens of behavioural science and web analytics.

## The Challenge
In a saturated digital entertainment market, brands must move beyond simple advertising to understand the "why" behind consumer actions. This project addresses two distinct marketing objectives:
1. **Strategy Evaluation:** Analyzing how PlayStation uses inbound and outbound marketing to influence user behavior and drive console loyalty.
2. **Competitive Benchmarking:** Utilizing real-world traffic data to identify PlayStation’s digital strengths and weaknesses relative to its primary competitor, Xbox.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into two independent parts:

### Part 1: Case Study – Sony Interactive Entertainment
A comprehensive audit of PlayStation's marketing ecosystem and the behavioural triggers used to engage its audience.
* **Outbound Strategies:** Evaluated the effectiveness of high-production paid video ads, strategic influencer sponsorships, and esports/event integration in driving brand recall.
* **Inbound Strategies:** Analyzed "conversion surfaces" including SEO content hubs (blogs), organic social community management, and app-based store interfaces.
* **Audience Segmentation:** Defined key segments based on demographic (age/location), psychographic (lifestyle/values), and behavioural (usage rates/loyalty) factors.
* **Behavioural Analysis:** Explored the application of psychological principles—such as the **Fogg Behaviour Model**—to explain how PlayStation triggers user action through motivation and ability.



### Part 2: Comparative Web Analytics (PlayStation vs. Xbox)
A data-driven competitive analysis using **Similarweb** metrics to evaluate market performance.
* **Performance Metrics:** Critically compared Global, Country, and Industry ranks, alongside traffic engagement data (total visits, bounce rates, and session duration).
* **Channel Breakdown:** Analyzed the marketing mix, comparing the reliance on Direct, Organic Search, Paid Search, Social, and Display Ads between the two platforms.
* **Ad Monetisation & Social Traffic:** Evaluated publisher networks and social media referral sources (e.g., PlayStation's dependency on Twitter/X vs. Xbox’s YouTube dominance).
* **Strategic Recommendations:** Provided five actionable, data-driven strategies for PlayStation, focusing on geographic diversification, mobile optimization, and enhancing video-led discovery.

* **Proposed Roadmap:** A set of tactical recommendations to improve PlayStation's retention in underperforming geographies and reduce dependency on volatile social channels.
* **Data-Driven Evaluation:** Full comparative reports supported by Similarweb screenshots, engagement charts, and behavioural science assessments.
