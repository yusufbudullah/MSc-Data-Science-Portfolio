# Research Methodology: From Social Media Insights to Organizational Strategy

This repository contains two distinct academic research works completed for the Research Methodology module. These projects focus on different domains, one exploring the broader impact of **Social Media Big Data** and the other proposing a specific **Organizational Memory Model** for an IT consultancy.

## The Challenge
While separate in focus, both projects address the modern challenge of information management:
1. **The External Challenge:** Understanding how the explosion of social media data creates both strategic opportunities for businesses and significant ethical/privacy risks.
2. **The Internal Challenge:** Addressing "knowledge leakage" within a professional services firm (*Itelligence*) by designing a system to capture and reuse technical expertise effectively.

## Project Structure
The repository is divided into two independent parts:

### Part 1: Literature Review – Social Media & Big Data
This work focuses on the systematic process of conducting a literature review to synthesize current academic understanding of social media's role in the Big Data landscape.
* **Thematic Synthesis:** Analyzed how user-generated content enables real-time competitor analysis and dynamic pricing models.
* **Ethical Audit:** Investigated privacy hazards and the necessity for corporate transparency standards in the wake of major data breaches.
* **Methodology:** Demonstrated high-level academic synthesis by creating a detailed Literature Review Matrix, categorizing sources by methodology, findings, and research gaps.

### Part 2: Project Proposal – Organizational Memory Model
This work outlines a formal research proposal for a technical solution to improve internal knowledge management at an Oracle NetSuite ERP provider.
* **Problem Identification:** Tackled the inefficiency of teams rebuilding software components or solving recurring client queries from scratch.
* **Research Design:** Proposed a qualitative case study utilizing staff surveys and interviews to map internal knowledge flows.
* **Technical Framework:** Utilized the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** lifecycle to structure the proposed development of a Business Intelligence-driven knowledge repository.

* **Strategic Goal:** To create a "conceptual memory" that allows for the storage and retrieval of code snippets, technical resolutions, and project documentation.

---

## Key Skills & Tools
* **Research Literacy:** Systematic Literature Review (SLR) techniques and academic paper synthesis.
* **Project Planning:** Developing comprehensive research proposals, including problem statements, Gantt charts, and resource planning.
* **Methodological Frameworks:** Application of CRISP-DM for data-centric projects and APA 7th Edition for professional documentation.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:** Designing qualitative research tools (surveys/interviews) to gather organizational requirements.

---

## Core Concepts
* **Knowledge Management:** Capturing internal expertise to prevent data loss during staff turnover.
* **Big Data Synergy:** The intersection of real-time external data (Social Media) with internal decision-making.
* **Systematic Review:** The process of identifying and critically evaluating all relevant research on a specific topic.

---

## Key Results & Outputs
* **Literature Matrix:** A structured appendix summarizing the state of Big Data research in 2025.
* **Formal Proposal:** A ready-to-implement research blueprint for developing a Business Intelligence model to enhance organizational competitiveness.
* **Ethical Guidelines:** Recommendations for balancing data-driven innovation with user privacy.
